# Terraform

There are 3 main tasks of Terraform - 
1. It is an infrastructure provisioning tool, means adding new servers, network configuration, adding Load balancer - configuration at infrastructure level.
2. Configuration of provisioned infrastrucure - installing apps on servers, managing those apps, prepare infrastructure to deploy the app.
3. Deployment of application.

But you know, Docker can do both 2nd and 3rd task.
Terraform and ansible can do somewhat similar tasks.

There are many tools available in the market for these task they can not do all tasks all alone, so can be differentiate in Procedural and declarative tools, some are mutable and immutable tools and some are agent and agentless tools.

what is differencet between Ansible and Terraform -
1. Both IaC tools - Provisioning, Configuring and managing infrastructure.
2. Ansible is mainly Configuration tool and Terraform is mainly infrastructure provisioning tool.
3. Ansible is mature and Terraform is new. 
4. Both can be used at a time.

It follows a declarative approach and not a procedural - In a declarative approach, you will tell what you need and not how it is to be done. Just say what you want in your Infrastructure, and it will manage all the necessary steps to get the things done

Files -
1. main.tf - This file defines what to create / what will be the end result / desired state.
Difference between current and desired state is a Plan. i.e., Plan means what to Create/Update/Destroyed ?

There are many providers - AWS, Azure, Kia, GCP, Alibaba etc. There are over 100 providers are there.

What is its Core?
Itâ€™s a binary written in Go programming language. The compiled binary corresponds to CLI terraform.
Core is responsible for :
Reading the configuration files, i.e., IaC.
State management of various resources.
Construction of resource graph.
Execution of plan.
Communication with plugins.

Commands -
1. Terraform Refresh - Gets updated state of infrastructure from provider.
2. Terraform Plan - Creates execution plan. Determines what actions are necessary to achieve the desired state.
3. Terraform Apply - Executes the plan.
4. Terraform Destroy - Destroy the infrastructure sequentially, we dont have to know in which order you need to delete the resources.
5. Terraform State - terraform maintains the current state and desired state
  Terraform State list - used to list the provider resources
  Terraform State show <resource_name> - used to see details of particular resource
  Terraform State mv - 
  Terraform State rm
  Terraform State pull
  Terraform State push
  Terraform State replace-provider

For development, you should install Terraform plugin in VSCode IDE.

Terraform maintains the current state and desired state in files - 
terrafrom.tfstate = stores current state of resources which are created in mentioned provider account
terraform.tfstate.backup = stores previous state of resources which were created in mentioned provider account

Output - we can print or reuse return values by this keyword as -

Enter variable/pass value to a variable by 3 ways -
1. While Terraform-apply command - we get prompt to enter value for variable - we need to declare using keyword "variable"
2. While Terraform-apply command - pass commandline argument as - terraform apply -var  "variable_name=value"
3. best practice and most efficient - using variable file - fileName.tfvars - declare variable there. same like yml file in ansible but in order to make it work we have to declare "variable" section in main.tf file.
If we give variable file name as - "terraform.tfvars" then terraform will automatically recognize/find variable file and use their variables. 
If we give different file name then - we have to pass variable file name as command - "terraform apply -var-file variable_filename.tfvars"

Usecase for using variable = we can setup same infra for different types of environment like - QA, development etc. like ansible we can create different files for different environments.

we can use feature of default value in terraform, which will make passing variable file optional.
Also for variable, we can set variable type - Boolean, String, Number

we can define list type of variable too and access nth number of variable in main.tf file as -
in variblefile.tfvars file -
subnet_cidr_block = ["172.31.48.0/20", "172.31.38.0/20"]

in main.tf file -
var.vpc_cidr_block[0]

so we may update descritpion of variable section also (this is optional).

likewise we can define type of "Object" too
ex. 

Do not useredentials directory inside script.
There are 2 ways the credentials - 
1. environmental variable - using "export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=ABCD" - just use same variable name as it should be declare inside "provider" section.
  check environmental variables using - "env | grep AWS" OR we can declare those credentials inside ~/.aws/credentials file. Terraform will automatically picked it up. If we are using this way then we can remove credentials/keys provided in Provider section of main.tf file. For this also we need to declare "variable" section.
